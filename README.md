Just run `bash js.sh` in the terminal for npm packages.
Make sure npm is installed. If not, install by [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
Also, make sure Eslint extension is installed in vs-code. If not, [install from the vs-code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).
